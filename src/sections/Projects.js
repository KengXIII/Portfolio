            The SPA functions as a tool, systematically parsing raw code snippets to answer user queries regarding the 
            relationships between variables and statement numbers. In my project role, I specialised in developing the 
            design extractor component. This component extracts key information from the data structure after parsing 
            the raw code, subsequently forwarding it to the program knowledge base for future use. Additionally, I 
            contributed to the streamlining of test efforts through the implementation of automated script files and 
            CI workflows.

            Technical interview is crucial to every software engineer looking for a job.
            We built Peer Prep so that prior to their technical interview, programmers can
            practice typical questions â€” with a peer! The program offers a real-time code
            editor, a sizable question pool that distributes questions at random depending
            on the difficulty level selected, and a chat function that encourages
            collaboration between users who are matched. I co-developed this application
            with three other team members.

            Sarcasm means the use of irony to mock someone or something. This idea cannot be picked up by simple 
            sentimental analysis model, therefore requires careful detection. I explored the use of a deep learning 
            CNN model to predict the likelyhood of an English sentence being sarcastic. Using 1 million comments 
            scraped from Reddit, I managed to trained a model that could perform with an accuracy of 70% on unseen 
            instances.

            HelpMeMahjong is a chatbot on Telegram that recommends the best next move based on the possible 
            combinations that the user could create. When users are listening to the last tile, the chatbot will

            tasks are approaching. Users may choose to customize the ideal time before reminding themselves.
