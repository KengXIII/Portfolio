                    My name is Keng I (pronounced as Keng Yi •ᴗ•) My first foray into programming started off with a simple goal: to automate interactions using LUA scripting.
                    This ignited my lasting passion for coding and problem solving.

                <div className="mt-5">
                    My undergraduate coursework focused on development, security and artificial intelligence.
                    Beyond coding, I find great satisfaction in tackling cybersecurity challenges as we navigate the transformative landscape of the digital age.
                    My appetite for challenges led me to delve into deep learning and AI in my later years of university, with the aspiration of utilising them as tools 
                    for effective problem-solving.
